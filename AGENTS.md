This repository uses the Zephyr Project Knowledge Framework (PKF).

## Code Search

- Prefer `rg` (ripgrep) for text search and file discovery.
- Prefer `sg` (ast-grep) for syntax-aware code searches and refactoring.
- Avoid `grep -r` unless `rg` is unavailable.

### General Python Best Practices

- Constants: Use immutable global constant collections (tuple, frozenset, immutabledict) to avoid hard-to-find bugs. Prefer constants over wild string/int literals, especially for dictionary keys, pathnames, and enums.
- Naming: Name mappings like `value_by_key` to enhance readability in lookups (e.g., `item = item_by_id[id]`).
- Readability: Use f-strings for concise string formatting, but use lazy-evaluated `%`-based templates for logging. Use `repr()` or `pprint.pformat()` for human-readable debug messages. Use `_` as a separator in numeric literals to improve readability.
- Comprehensions: Use list, set, and dict comprehensions for building collections concisely.
- Iteration: Iterate directly over containers without indices. Use `enumerate()` when you need the index, `dict.items()` for keys and values, and `zip()` for parallel iteration.
- Built-ins: Leverage built-in functions like `all()`, `any()`, `reversed()`, `sum()`, etc., to write more concise and efficient code.
- Flattening Lists: Use `itertools.chain.from_iterable()` to flatten a list of lists efficiently without unnecessary copying.
- String Methods: Use `startswith()` and `endswith()` with a tuple of strings to check for multiple prefixes or suffixes at once.
- Decorators: Use decorators to add common functionality (like logging, timing, caching) to functions without modifying their core logic. Use `functools.wraps()` to preserve the original function's metadata.
- Context Managers: Use `with` statements and context managers (from `contextlib` or custom classes with `__enter__`/`__exit__`) to ensure resources are properly initialized and torn down, even in the presence of exceptions.
- Else Clauses: Utilize the `else` clause in `try/except` blocks (runs if no exception), and in `for/while` loops (runs if the loop completes without a `break`) to write more expressive and less error-prone code.
- Single Assignment: Prefer single-assignment form (assign to a variable once) over assign-and-mutate to reduce bugs and improve readability. Use conditional expressions where appropriate.
- Equality vs. Identity: Use `is` or `is not` for singleton comparisons (e.g., `None`, `True`, `False`). Use `==` for value comparison.
- Object Comparisons: When implementing custom classes, be careful with `__eq__`. Return `NotImplemented` for unhandled types. Consider edge cases like subclasses and hashing. Prefer using `attrs` or `dataclasses` to handle this automatically.
- Hashing: If objects are equal, their hashes must be equal. Ensure attributes used in `__hash__` are immutable. Disable hashing with `__hash__ = None` if custom `__eq__` is implemented without a proper `__hash__`.
- `__init__()` vs. `__new__()`: `__new__()` creates the object, `__init__()` initializes it. For immutable types, modifications must happen in `__new__()`.
- Default Arguments: NEVER use mutable default arguments. Use `None` as a sentinel value instead.
- `__add__()` vs. `__iadd__()`: `x += y` (in-place add) can modify the object in-place if `__iadd__` is implemented (like for lists), while `x = x + y` creates a new object. This matters when multiple variables reference the same object.
- Properties: Use `@property` to create getters and setters only when needed, maintaining a simple attribute access syntax. Avoid properties for computationally expensive operations or those that can fail.
- Modules for Namespacing: Use modules as the primary mechanism for grouping and namespacing code elements, not classes. Avoid `@staticmethod` and methods that don't use `self`.
- Argument Passing: Python is call-by-value, where the values are object references (pointers). Assignment binds a name to an object. Modifying a mutable object through one name affects all names bound to it.
- Keyword/Positional Arguments: Use `*` to force keyword-only arguments and `/` to force positional-only arguments. This can prevent argument transposition errors and make APIs clearer, especially for functions with multiple arguments of the same type.
- Type Hinting: Annotate code with types to improve readability, debuggability, and maintainability. Use abstract types from `collections.abc` for container annotations (e.g., `Sequence`, `Mapping`, `Iterable`). Annotate return values, including `None`. Choose the most appropriate abstract type for function arguments and return types.
- `NewType`: Use `typing.NewType` to create distinct types from primitives (like `int` or `str`) to prevent argument transposition and improve type safety.
- `__repr__()` vs. `__str__()`: Implement `__repr__()` for unambiguous, developer-focused string representations, ideally evaluable. Implement `__str__()` for human-readable output. `__str__()` defaults to `__repr__()`.
- F-string Debug: Use `f"{expr=}"` for concise debug printing, showing both the expression and its value.
